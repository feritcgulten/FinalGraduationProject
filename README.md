individuals in various areas and issues. Twitter is one of these social media
platforms with its wide communication network. In addition, Twitter has become a
popular social media platform for sharing and communication in the field of health.
It has the potential to have a significant impact on individuals in the field of health,
as it is a platform used by both the public to obtain information and the scientists to
share information. At this point, the analysis of the tweets and tweet owner on
Twitter in the field of health for Turkey has been considered as an important topic
to be focused on. In light of all this, the main purpose of this study is identifying and
predicting trending healthcare topics and influential people in Turkey in a specific
time period. Thus, important health issues and problems in Turkey will be
determined. Accounts with potential impact in the field of health will be identified.
In line with this goal, an efficient model as a method is proposed for determining
healthcare trending topics and influential people. The proposed method includes
the n-grams algorithm to identify trending topics and social network analysis to
